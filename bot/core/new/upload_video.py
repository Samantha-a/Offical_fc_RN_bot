        Advanced Video Uploader Function.

        :param chat_id: Unique identifier (int) or username (str) of the target chat. For your personal cloud (Saved Messages) you can simply use "me" or "self". For a contact that exists in your Telegram address book you can use his phone number (str).
        :param video: Video to send. Pass a video file path as string to upload a new video that exists on your local machine.
        :param editable_message: Pass editable Message object for updating with progress text.
        :param parse_mode: By default, texts are parsed using both Markdown and HTML styles. You can combine both syntaxes together. Pass "markdown" or "md" to enable Markdown-style parsing only. Pass "html" to enable HTML-style parsing only. Pass None to completely disable style parsing.
        :param caption: Video caption, 0-1024 characters.
        :param caption_entities: List of special entities that appear in the caption, which can be specified instead of *parse_mode*.
        :param ttl_seconds: Self-Destruct Timer. If you set a timer, the video will self-destruct in *ttl_seconds* seconds after it was viewed.
        :param duration: Duration of sent video in seconds. By default function will try to get duration data from video.
        :param width: Video width. By default function will try to get width data from video.
        :param height: Video height. By default function will try to get height data from video.
        :param thumb: Thumbnail of the video sent. The thumbnail should be in JPEG format and less than 200 KB in size. A thumbnail's width and height should not exceed 320 pixels. Thumbnails can't be reused and can be only uploaded as a new file. By default function will take random screenshot from video and use it as thumbnail.
        :param file_name: File name of the video sent. Defaults to file's path basename.
        :param supports_streaming: Pass True, if the uploaded video is suitable for streaming. Defaults to True.
        :param disable_notification: Sends the message silently. Users will receive a notification with no sound.
        :param reply_to_message_id: If the message is a reply, ID of the original message.
        :param schedule_date: Date when the message will be automatically sent. Unix time.
        :param reply_markup: Additional interface options. An object for an inline keyboard, custom reply keyboard, instructions to remove reply keyboard or to force a reply from the user.
        :param status_message: Pass status string. Default: "ðŸ“¤ Uploading as Video ..."
